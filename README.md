# -VSh-Estimation-in-Seismic-Volume-Using-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on calculating the volume of shale (VSh) in a seismic dataset using machine learning techniques. By leveraging seismic attributes, we trained a model to estimate VSh efficiently, providing insights into subsurface lithology distribution.
